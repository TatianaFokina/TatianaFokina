# Hi, this is Tanya

I'm a web accessibility specialist and enthusiast who like to developing user-friendly interfaces. Obviously, my true passion is web accessibility (or a11y for short). Even I focus more on web accessibility front-end and web development aren't strangers to me.

My bonus non-professional superpower is dog and cat whispering 🐈

## Writings and talks 🖊️

My other passion is tech writing. I bet you've already guessed my favorite topic, ha-ha. If not, I can give you a clue: The topic contains two letters “a” and “y” divided by the number “11”. If you are curious about it, check [the list of my writings and translations](https://github.com/TatianaFokina/my-articles-and-talks/blob/main/links-en.md) or go to [my personal blog](https://tatiana-fokina-blog.ru/en/).

Sometimes I realize that I can talk and have talks (as you can see, my logic is bulletproof.) A few years ago, I was a co-organizer of the first Russian-speaking meetup on accessibility [pitera11y_meetup](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTdS5E3zupkGg0FoMoWB5FD2tlBrSWUQB). I have experience being a speaker and, at the same time, a person who aren't sleep a wink because of organizer's duties. You know, you need to find a place for an event, bring speakers, review their talks, slides, and so on. Pretty stressful duty!

## Podcasts 🎙️

In April 2023, I decided it wasn't too late to start my own podcast. This is how the first Russian-speaking podcast about accessibility and inclusion, titled [Inclusive Pineapple](https://inclusivepineapple.github.io) (because why not?), was created. Of course, I'm not alone. Glasha Zhur, my incredible co-host and an accessibility lead from Semrush, joins me.

I prepare topics and materials for discussions, record the audio, assist with audio mixing, transcribing, captioning, and update the podcast website… In short, I handle all typical podcaster tasks.

Occasionally, I appear as a guest on other tech podcasts, such as [the Web Stadards Podcast](https://web-standards.ru/podcast/). It is one of the most popular Russian-language podcasts with 28.2K subscribers on YouTube.
